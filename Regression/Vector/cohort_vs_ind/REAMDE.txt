cohort_vs_ind

The purpose of this set of tests is:

1) Provide simple tests that show some of the basic features of the vector model
2) Provide a simple way to compare the cohort and individual models over these basic features

The set of tests were created using the files in test_creation_files.

All of the tests have the same dtk_post_process.py file.
An improvement would be to refactor this so that the amount
of code duplication is reduced.

The same goes for the campaign and custom report files.
If r_t.py can be fixed so that the test doesn't have to
have actual copies of these files, then we could reduce
the amount of duplication.

To compare cohort vs individual, one just needs to change the Vector_Sampling_Type
paramter in the default_config.json file and re-run the tests.
The dtk_post_process.py will convert the ReportVectorStats.csv file
to a json file so that we can compare and plot this data.  With this,
one should be able to quickly and easily see the difference in the two models.
