Too Many Males

This test was created to ensure an issue was resolved where too many males were being created.
The scenario releases some male mosquitos such that the females they mate with will only
produce male eggs.  The gene drive is used to accelerate the population but the real thing
to look at here is the number of male.

Given this scenario, one would expect that the females will die off and then so will all of
the vectors.  However, the number of males at the peak should still be roughly the same as
the total number of females during their peak.

This test was created because we saw an issue where the number of males at the peak was an
order of magnitude greater than the peak number of females.  It turned out this was because
we were only adding the female eggs and larva to the habitat.  As the number of males became
greater than the number females, the larva capacity became greater and greater since the 
males were not being added.  Since the capacity was greater, we didn't kill of eggs and larva
due to crowding.
