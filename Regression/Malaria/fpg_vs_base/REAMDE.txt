fpg_vs_base

The purpose of this set of tests is:

1) Provide sweeps over the main interventions
2) Provide a simple way to compare the base malaria model with full parasite genetics version

The set of tests were created using the files in create_tests.py.

All of the tests have the same dtk_post_process.py file.
An improvement would be to refactor this so that the amount
of code duplication is reduced.

To compare fpg vs base, one just needs to change the Malaria_Model
paramter in the default_config.json file and re-run the tests.
The dtk_post_process.py will convert the ReportVectorStats.csv file
to a json file so that we can compare and plot this data.  With this,
one should be able to quickly and easily see the difference in the two models.
